Ecological non-linear state spac emodel selection via adapative particle MCMC

Non-linear state space ecological models (population growth models)

1. Introduction

SSM inference involves jointly estimating the latent state vector and the static parameter vector
of the models for observations and states.

Neither EKF nor MH and Gibbs works properly for parameter posterior inference because
the models are highly non-linear and the joint lh surface can be multimodal.

-> Particle MCMC algorithm for joint process and parameter estimation in non linear and non Gaussian SSM
coupled with and adaptive Metropolis proposal (?).

Objectives :
- examine the perf of the new algo in non linear population growth model with complex lh surfaces
- re-examine the problems of model selection with Bates factors estimated via MC samples.

1.1 Contribution

The paper addresses three main concerns about model fitting to ecological time series :
- inclusion of observation error (otherwise can lead to biased estimates and can have an effect on model selection)
- model simplification : not needed with the approach used in the paper
- efficient estimation and robust model selection
