# Presentation

This repository contains the material conceived for a final year project in Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods at ENSAE ParisTech.

The goal of the project was to implement a SMC method from scratch.
We chose to work on ecological non-linear state space model. We applied the method we implemented on the "nutria" dataset.
